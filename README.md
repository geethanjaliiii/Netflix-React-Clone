# Netflix-React-Clone
Netflix Clone App 🎬🍿 This project is a Netflix clone built using React with a config-driven UI. The app dynamically fetches data from the TMDB API, rendering new content every time the page is refreshed. Users can browse trending movies and TV shows, and play trailers when they click on the posters.
