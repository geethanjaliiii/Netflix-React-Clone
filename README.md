# Netflix Clone

A fully functional Netflix clone built using React and the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. The app features a dynamic, configuration-driven UI that fetches and renders new content on reload. Users can browse movie posters, and upon clicking, watch the movie trailers.

- **Dynamic Content**: The app fetches data from TMDB API and renders new content whenever the page is reloaded.
- **Movie Trailers**: Users can click on movie posters to watch the trailer.
